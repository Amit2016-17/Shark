=========

We are working on the first official release of Shark 4.0.
Get the latest snapshot from our svn repository!

Shark sources
-------------

   We have two source packages available:

   `Shark-4.0.0.zip <https://github.com/Shark-ML/Shark/archive/v4.0.0.zip>`_
   
   `Shark-4.0.0.tar.gz <https://github.com/Shark-ML/Shark/archive/v4.0.0.tar.gz>`_

   See the :doc:`installation guide <installation>`
   for details on how to compile and install the library.

Shark repository
----------------

Get a current Shark repository snapshot (a ``Shark`` directory
will be created as a subfolder -- if you want the tree contents directly in the current
directory, add a space and period ``.`` to the end of the command):

.. code-block:: none

      git clone https://github.com/Shark-ML/Shark/
